# Smart-Stadium
IoT Project 

Using Arduino Wemos D1, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, Blynk, Node-red, and MQTT, I created a smart stadium that measures the surrounding air and automatically decides to do actions based on the temperature and humidity level. For instance, if the temperature reaches higher than a certain degree the system decides to close the stadium's portable roof and turn on the air conditioners. The temperature, humidity, and the status of the stadium are available in real-time on three platforms (mobile app, Node-red server, and Thinger) and the system send a daily report to the owner through e-mail.
